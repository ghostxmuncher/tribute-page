        <h2 id="list-header">Here's a timeline of Bug Bijou's life: </h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>2002</strong> - Spawns in from the womb near Grand Junction, Colorado on June 14th, the same birthday as Daddy Trump.</li>
            <li><strong>2004</strong> - Poo poo and pee peed alone for the first time.</li>
            <li><strong>2010</strong> - Deep in the midst of belieberism, Jewel was busy belting Baby! Baby! Baby! Oooooo!</li>
            <li><strong>2013</strong> - The dawn of emo-ism. Jewel was gripped by the shitty vocals of 21 pilots and the hardcore punk band <em>The Front Bottoms</em>. </li>
            <li><strong>2016</strong> - Cast as the crtitical role of <em>The Milky White</em> in Shel Silverstein's Oz. Her performance inspired many characters in horror films and childrens tales. Some say this role defines Bijou and could be her <em>magnum opus</em>.</li>
            <li><strong>2019</strong> - Elected as head of the <em>Ecological Protection and Restoration</em> club. This postition would launch her to a seat on the UNFCCC, if she chose to accept. But, love had other plans...</li>
            <li><strong>2020</strong> - April 5th, 2020. A fateful bitter cold night. Her life would never be the same after lying on that dewey grass and kissing that <em>weeeiiirrrd</em> man.</li>
            <li><strong>2021</strong> - Moves to Reno, Nevada to begin her life as a student of the arts. Quickly discovers Reno is an armpit.</li>
            <li><strong>2022</strong> - Transfers studies to Durango, Colorado. A quaint mountain town known as a black hole by the locals. Her trend-setting tattoo career found it's roots in the depths of her 526sq ft apartment.</li>
            <li><strong>2023</strong> - Conquers the world. She became America's best rookie of the year tattoo artist and went viral on instagram for her multitude of artistic displays. Some of which include: <em>Crocheting, drawing, tattooing, designing, being beautiful, dressing all-cute-like, making amazing dinners, and being the best girlfriend in the entire world</em>.</li>
            <li><strong>The Future</strong> - San Diego? Probably. New Zealand? <em>Most definitely</em>. Marriage? It's Everyday Bro! Another kitty? Maybe at some point. Bug Bijou's tattoo shop? Most <em>certainly</em>. </li>
        </ul>
